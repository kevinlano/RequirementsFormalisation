This approach consists of a simplified version of the AgileUML approach, coded in Python. Heuristics are used to split user story text
into actor, action and auxiliary text elements. Classes are also extracted from the text. 

The input file is hardcoded as k3ucs.txt in this version.
Run as: python nlpucs.py
