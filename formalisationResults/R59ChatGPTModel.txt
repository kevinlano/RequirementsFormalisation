Relationships:

FSW is associated with SCU, Camera, Clock, Heater, and TAM.
ObservationSequence is part of FSW.
SCU sends commands and time messages to FSW and receives data from it.
Camera captures images and processes data.
Clock is synchronized by FSW.
Heater is controlled by FSW.
TAM provides telemetry data.
