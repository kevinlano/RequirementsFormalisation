# RequirementsFormalisation
Repository of state-of-the art requirements formalisation approaches, evaluated on common examples 

This repository provides a common set of requirements statement cases, so that RF approaches can be compared on their results when applied to the same cases. 

Cases are divided into 3 categories: (i) unstructured documents, such as background material on a domain; (ii) semi-structured documents, such as user stories, which have an expected but flexible format; (iii) fully-structured documents according to a grammar or other formal definition.

A set of evaluation tools are also provided to carry out (i) comparison of produced models to a 'gold standard' or reference formalisation carried out by a human expert (accuracy check); (ii) comparison of the produced model to the original document to identify how much information has been captured (completeness check); (iii) internal quality check of the model to determine if it is a valid model and what its quality level is.

Authors of RF approaches are welcome to contribute a description and tooling for their approach, and to apply their approach on the case studies.
