Operational Concepts

The following sections describe the operational concepts of the FSW, including its functions, interfaces, performance characteristics, error detection, reporting and recovery mechanisms, and ground systems concepts. 

Functions

The FSW has the following primary functions:
Process science data from the camera and relay it to the Spacecraft Control Unit (SCU) in the form of CCSDS Source Packets.

Receive commands from the SCU that establish the current instrument state and camera mode.

Transmit detailed housekeeping data to the SCU in the form of CCSDS Source Packets.

Receive a time message from the SCU and synchronize the XCP local copy of the spacecraft clock.

Control the heaters on the telescope tube and the thermal baffles.

Read the TAM.

Observation Sequence

The XRT supports three different but very similar observation sequences. The three observation types are:
Automatic, Preplanned, Target of Opportunity.

Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a detailed flowchart for the observation types. The sequence shown in the figures assumes the software is in automatic mode and not presently performing an observation. 

The sequence starts when a SISCATTITUDE message is received with the IS_SETTLED indication set to false. The message also indicates IS_IN_10_ARCMIN, which is true when the S/C is within ten arc minutes of the target position. When the distance remaining to slew is greater than ten arc minutes, the S/C begins the first of up to three activities that precede an observation. 

Each activity is initiated when the distance remaining is greater than ten arc minutes, and the previous activity is complete. 

The pre-observation activities are:
Calculate row bias map,
Calculate image bias map,
Collect raw data image.
