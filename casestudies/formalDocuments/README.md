This directory contains examples of formally-structured requirements documents. We understand this to mean that there is a grammar
to which the documents conform. 

An example is the bathel_reprint.pdf document, which presents the Barthel Index on page 2 in a strict tabular format. 
The formal content is in barthelFormalDefinition.txt, the grammar to which this 
conforms is given in BarthelIndex.g4, and the parsed content in barthelIndexAST.txt
