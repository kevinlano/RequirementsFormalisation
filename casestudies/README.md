This directory contains the source text/images of semi-formal evaluation cases for requirements formalisation tools. 

These are of two kinds: cases of user stories; cases of data requirements.

All cases are taken from real-world examples, extracted from published sources of software requirements. They are intended to be representative of actual 
requirements documents created by requirements analysts.
